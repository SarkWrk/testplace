## Labelling Your PR/Issue

Please label your Issues and PRs correctly.
>[!IMPORTANT]
>When you create a PR/Issue, you have certain labels that can be added to it to make it more distinct. These options are:
>- **bug**             | *Used when you think that something isn't working correctly*
>- **documentation**   | *Used for improving documentation*
>- **enhancement**     | *Used when you are making a backwards-compatible suggestion/PR*
>- **expiremental**    |Â *Used when you are making a non-backwards-compatible suggestion/PR*
>- **question**        | *Used when you're unsure if you have found a bug, but still want to report it*
>- **suggestion**      | *Used when you want to make a suggestion*

>[!NOTE]
>When your Issue/PR has been seen, labels may be added to it or removed from it. These labels may include:
>- **attention**         | *Used for when a bug/question doesn't seem right due to how the script is coded*
>- **duplicate**         | *Used for when an Issue/PR is a duplicate of a different Issue/PR*
>- **help wanted**       | *Used for when an Issue/PR has a hard time being fixed, and external help would be heavily welcomed*
>- **noteabug**          | *Used for when an Issue/PR tagged with `question` or `bug` is not a bug*
>- **wonthappen**         | *Used for when an Issue/PR (bug, question, or suggestion) will not be worked on*

## Making A Suggestion
>[!NOTE]
>When you are making a suggestion, do not follow the formatting guide for making an Issue or PR.

>[!CAUTION]
>Always label suggestions with the `suggestion` label and an appropriate `enhancement` or `expiremental` label.

When you are making a suggestion you have two options: making an Issue and making a PR.
If you're willing to put your code inside the codebase, make a PR. Otherwise, make an Issue.

### Making a suggestion through an Issue:
When you are creating your Issue, preface in the title that it's a suggestion via putting [SUGGESTION\] at the start of the title. And format your Issue like this:

**[Goal of the suggestion\]**

[Why you think this suggestion should be added\]

### Making a suggestion through a PR:
When you are creating your PR, preface in the title that it's a suggestion via putting [SUGGESTION\] at the start of the title. And format your PR like this:

**[Goal of the suggestion\] | [Stability of the code\]**

[Why you think this suggestion should be added\]

[If applicable: any documentation changes that should be added/removed due to your code changes\]

>[!CAUTION]
>When adding your code, always make sure to comment what important parts of your code do. E.g.: Functions and important variables.
>
>**Any non-commented PR suggestions will be closed without consideration.**

## Making An Issue
When making an issue, please format your issue like this (formatting is not required, but warmly welcomed):

**Issue:**

[What the issue you're having/noticed is\]

[An explanation of what you think the issue is, and why you think it's an issue\]

**(IF AVAILABLE\) Evidence:**

[A video and/or image proof of what the issue is\]

[If the evidence is not **easily** able to be understood outside of context, please explain what is going on in your evidence\]

**(OPTIONAL\) How To Fix The Issue:**

[A description/explanation of how you think the issue can be fixed.\]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**If you know how to code it and are willing to put it into the codebase, please make a [PR](https://github.com/SarkWrk/TestPathExperience/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-a-pr) instead of an issue**

## Making A PR
>[!NOTE]
>When making a PR, you understand that, if merged, your code will become a part of the codebase and may be removed or modified at any moment.
>
>You also understand that you will be given credit to for the code you contributed on. When accrediting you, if no external means of credit (like a Youtube channel/Discord username/etc) is provided, your GitHub profile with be credited.

When you are making a PR, please include the labels `enhancement` or `expiremental` depending on what you're changing.

If your code adds/removes any attributes or adds/removes any \*Events/\*Functions, include a `documentation` label and include any necessary documentation changes/additions.

Please format your PR like this (formatting is not required, but warmly welcomed):

**Issue:**

[What the issue you're having/noticed is\]

[An explanation of what you think the issue is, and why you think it's an issue\]

**Code:**

[What your code does\]

*Code stability:* [How stable your code is\]

**(If applicable) Documentation Changes:**
